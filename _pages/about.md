I am a Senior Portfolio Manager at Storebrand Asset Management, where I manage global index, ESG, and factor equity funds. Before joining Storebrand, I worked in fixed income research at MSCI in Berkeley, CA, and at RiskMetrics in Geneva. Additionally, I have worked in risk management at Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). I hold a PhD in Finance from the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH), an MSc in Financial Engineering from Columbia University, and an MSc (Sivil√∏konom) in Financial Economics from NHH.

Research

My main research interest is in empirical finance, particularly topics related to investing strategies, asset pricing, and portfolio management.
