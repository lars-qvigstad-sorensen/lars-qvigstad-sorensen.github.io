This report contains a quantitative evaluation of the investment performance of Folketrygdfondet's fund Statens Pensjonsfond Norge, henceforth referred to as the Fund. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance instructed MSCI to evaluate the Fund’s historical track record for the period 1998Q1-2010Q2, with a particular emphasis on possible exposures to systematic risk factors. The mandate from the Ministry of Finance requested that we prepare an evaluation of the Fund’s performance including the following:

- Distinguish between the total fund level and the four sub-portfolios (Norwegian equities, 
Norwegian fixed income, Nordic equities, and Nordic fixed income). 
- Specify to what extent the investments have been based on obtaining exposure to different 
systematic risk factors, including possibly time-varying exposure to these factors, and the 
significance of this exposure with respect to the Fund performance. 
- Hold the results from the quantitative analysis up against the fact that the Fund’s asset 
allocation and governance structure has changed significantly since 1998.
