- Investigates the predictability of stock market returns by lagged oil price changes.
- Excluding extreme geopolitical events, oil prices no longer predict stock returns.
- Three wars and the 1986 OPEC collapse generate most of the predictability.
- Trading based on oil prices generates insignificant abnormal returns in most markets.
- Shows that significant time-series predictors may not be useful market-timing signals.

We show that the ability of oil price changes to predict stock returns is limited to periods of extreme geopolitical unrest. Four events generate most of the predictability: the 1973 Arab-Israel war, the 1986 OPEC collapse, the 1990/91 Persian gulf war, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. We also find that a market-timing trading strategy based on oil price changes typically generates insignificant abnormal returns, contradicting previously published results. Our findings serve as an example of how a significant predictor in a time series forecasting regression may not be a useful or profitable market-timing signal.
